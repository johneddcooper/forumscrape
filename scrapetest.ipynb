Nice guys often get delusional when a foid treats them with just a little bit of human dignity to the point that they think that the foid is interested in them. The worst kind of nice guys are the simps the sort of cucks who spend money on E-thots in exchange for something pathetic like a shout out or the cucks whom say shit like, \"I\\'d walk through the hottest desert covered in glass just so I can sniff her fart.\"\\n\\nNeck beards are what normies think we are, this is because to the normie all one needs to do is to shower, eat healthily and exercise as well as not dress like a retard. All of this advice would honestly help a lot of neckbeards not be physically disgusting. However our problems go a lot deeper than that of exercise or hygine as the problems we are face are due to bad genetics, shitty upbringing, mental scarring with school etc. Neckbeards are delusional and believe themselves to be the smarted and greatest people to ever exist.
