    "\n",
    "In the [previous post](https://learningautomaton.ca/2019/04/forum-scrape-project-data-processing-sanitation-and-anonymizing/) we cleaned and anonymized the data we scraped from the forum.\n",

    "To make this notebook interactive I have embedded the post contents into a string and included it in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will:\n",
    "* Strip out unneeded words from our data\n",
    "* Make a custom pipeline to label words as being fruit or vegetable words\n",
    "* Count mentions of fruits and vegetables, and find words describing fruits or veggies to get an idea of which is preferred on the forum\n",

    "## A Primer on Pipelines, and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend you take a look at the [spaCy doc page on pipelines](https://spacy.io/usage/processing-pipelines). \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, when you pass a string or iterable to a spaCy language object (retrieved using the spacy.load(language model) call), it passes the string through a series of pipes that each do a specific thing, and stores the results in the returned `Doc` object. \n",
    "    \n",
    "For example, a fairly standard (and default) pipeline is as follows:\n",
    "* The `tokenizer` pipe breaks the string into tokens (words) which are stored as `token` objects in the `doc`\n",
    "* The `tagger` pipe tries to identify what part of speech (pos) (noun, verb, adjective, etc) best describes each token, and adds it to that token's `pos` attribute\n",
    "* The `parser` pipe adds dependency labels to various attributes\n",
    "* The `ner` pipe tries to identify named entities and adds them to doc.ents\n",
    "* etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are some site-specific *slang* words for fruits and veggies we need to watch out for. In this data, \"apples\" are often referred to as \"pulls\". If we didn't explicitly label this word, it would be harder to find as spaCy sometimes tags it as a verb and sometime as a noun, depending on context."
