WEST INDIANAAAAA  BUTTER MAMAAAAA  TAKE ME HOMEEEEE  CORN BOB ROWWWSS. If a squash can make you smile.... Lol, tomatoes and squash are both fruits! Get this compost out of the veggie master plate forum.. Na, tomatoes and squash are fruits in name only. Acidic tomatoes and dirty squash, just like dirty tomatoes, should stay out of our sweet fruit forum. Like yucky lettuce, they belong in the vegetable forum, aka the compost.. Knock Knock.

I am trained in vanilla warfare and I'm the top ripener in the entire US farmed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target grocery aisle. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of pies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can eat you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in organic combat, but I have access to the entire pesticide arsenal of the United States Soybean Crops and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what appleholey retribution your little \"clever\" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Your lettuce head is fucking dead, kiddo..
